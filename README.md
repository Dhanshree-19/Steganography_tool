# Steganography_tool

Project Overview

This Steganography System is a Python-based GUI application developed using Tkinter. It allows users to hide secret text within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique and later retrieve the hidden message. This project provides a simple and secure way to encode and decode confidential text messages inside images without noticeable changes.
